        <h1> This is how to play the game War.</h1>
        The deck is split evenly between you and the Computer. <br/> You both draw a card at the same time.<br/>  Whoever has the highest number (Ace high, 2 lowest) wins the cards and adds it to their hand. <br/> The goal of war is to win all your opponents cards. <br/> For the sake of sanity, you will win the game if you win 75% of the deck (39 cards/52).
