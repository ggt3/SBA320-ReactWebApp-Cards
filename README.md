# SBA320-ReactWebApp-Cards
 war, the card game web app

Netlify link:

A project created using the [Deck API](https://www.deckofcardsapi.com/). I thought it would be fun to make a card game to play on the web, though I fear I made something simple incredibly complicated, but I was in too deep.

#####Technologies used: React, React-Bootstrap


Explanations of the approach taken.

####Unsolved problems:
* Currently have an issue with seeding the decks. Assuming I can create the two piles ("player" and "computer") appropriately in the API (by manually checking the console), then I can "play the game" appropriately and move cards around to each hand depending on the winner when clicking "battle!". 
* I have not implemented an important feature of war which is what happends when the cards ties in value
